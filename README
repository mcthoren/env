# env
the idea here, is that when i work on a new machine i can do:

git clone git@github.com:mcthoren/env.git

~/env/install_links

in my home dir, and then have exactly the same env i have everywhere.

note:
.Xresources -> .Xdefault
.xsession -> .xinitrc
might be necessary for older weider style unixes
