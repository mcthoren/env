# env
the idea here, is that when i work on a new machine i can do:

git clone git@github.com:mcthoren/env.git

ln -s ~/env/[2x]* ~/env/.[fXxz]* ./

in my home dir, and then have exactly the same env i have everywhere.

To Do:
i need to work in some more some abstractions for diff ways diff linuxes handle things relative to my bsd machines.
